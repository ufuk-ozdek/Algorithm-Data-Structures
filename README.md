# MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Fall 2011

by Ufuk Ozdek 

As a part of this course I implemented some of the algorithms covered in the lectures.

# Course Description
This course provides an introduction to mathematical modeling of computational problems. It covers the common algorithms, algorithmic paradigms, and data structures used to solve these problems. The course emphasizes the relationship between algorithms and programming, and introduces basic performance measures and analysis techniques for these problems.
